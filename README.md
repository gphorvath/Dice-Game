# Dice-Game
This repo serves as the release branch for my personal game development project (Dice Puzzle Adventure).

This is a slightly updated version of my [itch.io](https://game-shenanigans.itch.io/dice-puzzle-adventure) release that was a game jam submission for [Games Plus Jam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/gamesplusjam2022).

Written in C# using Unity. Not intended for mobile play.

:warning: No updates are planned for this game at this time. :warning:

[Click here to play! (Will make sound!)](https://gphorvath.github.io/Dice-Game/).

## Objective
Use the player dice (green outline) to eliminate all enemy dice (red outline).

## Instructions
1. Left click and drag a player die over an enemy die to attack.
2. Right click to reroll up to 2x per player die.
3. You may reroll after an attack if the player die survives.
4. You must win each level by at least 1.
5. If you lose, you will be returned to level 1 (at least until I add game saving).
6. There are 10 levels in total.
7. Enjoy!
